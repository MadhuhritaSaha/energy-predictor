# 🔋 Energy Consumption Predictor

Welcome to the **Energy Predictor** repository! This project focuses on predicting energy consumption using data-driven models, primarily developed in Jupyter Notebooks.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Energy consumption prediction is essential for efficient resource management in homes, offices, and industries. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and forecast energy usage patterns.

**Note:**  
The actual predictive model is currently implemented as a Jupyter Notebook and **not yet designed into a fully functional website**. Any updates regarding the deployment of the model as a web application will be provided here in the future.


## 🖥️ Interactive Usage

You can run and modify the notebooks directly in your browser using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Binder](https://mybinder.org/):
